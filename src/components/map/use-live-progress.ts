 * How far along the route the package sits right now, 0 to 1, kept live.
 *
 * The position is the honest one and nothing else: distance covered since
 * departure at the mode's real speed — 60 km/h on the road — and only while the
 * status says it is actually moving. It is read from the clock on a timer, so
 * the package advances at exactly the rate the thing itself advances.
 *
 * There is deliberately no glide up to that position. Animating the journey
 * already travelled crossed a couple of hundred kilometres in a few seconds,
 * which is not a speed any lorry makes and reads as obviously false. A package
 * that appears to barely move is the correct depiction of a package that is
 * barely moving: over a minute it covers a kilometre, and over an hour it
 * covers sixty, which is visible on the map exactly as it is on the road.
 *
 * A held shipment stops at the distance it had already covered — it never snaps
 * back to the origin, because `travelledProgress` stops accruing at `heldSince`
 * rather than resetting.
